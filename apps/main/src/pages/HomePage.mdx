# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Thomas and welcome to my website, where I record my journey as a software engineer. 

This website was originally built towards the end of my university degree when, disillusioned by the prospect 
of a career in video games, I decided to learn a few web dev tricks as a fallback. 
This decision led me to become a full stack web developer where I have grown very fond of web technologies. 
Every day I learn something new and am amazed by the wonders they enable us to create and experience. 

With this project, I want to keep learning new tricks and hopefully share my knowledge and experience üòÅ
