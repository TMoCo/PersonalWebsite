By writing tech demos, I hone my C++ programming skills whilst learning about new features and techniques.

Whilst writing my undergraduate thesis, I gained some web development experience on the following two websites:
  * An archeological dig site in Jordan.
  * A project on preserving cultural heritage in zones of conflict.

I designed and implemented their user interfaces and wrote the JavaScript used in the virtual tours of the
archeological website which was a lot of fun. In my spare time, I enjoy learning about web technologies like the
React JavaScript framework or new css tricks.

For my master's course, I wrote many C++ applications implementing techniques and concepts found in the
games industry! Click for more info.
